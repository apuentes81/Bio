            <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Greetings!</span>  I'm Alberto Puentes, a passionate and aspiring software developer eager to make my mark in the dynamic world of technology. Welcome to my entry-level software development portfolio, where I'm excited to share my journey and showcase the projects that reflect my skills, dedication, and growth as a developer. <br><br>
            As a graduate with a strong foundation in programming and a hunger for learning, I understand the importance of constantly evolving in the ever-changing tech landscape. This portfolio is not just a collection of projects but a representation of my enthusiasm, commitment, and potential in the field of software. <br><br>
            In these pages, you'll find a selection of projects that I've worked on during my academic journey, internships, and personal endeavors. These projects may not have the complexity of experienced professionals, but they embody the enthusiasm, creativity, and the drive to learn that I bring to every task.  <img src="./Pictures/tech_image.jpg" alt="Tech Image" class="tech_image"><br><br>
            My portfolio covers a range of technologies and languages, from web development to mobile applications and more. Each project showcases the skills I've acquired, the challenges I've overcome, and the solutions I've crafted. I'm eager to share my progress, from initial learning experiences to more recent accomplishments, as I strive to become a valuable contributor to the software development community. <br><br>
            I understand that entry-level talent is all about potential and willingness to grow, and I am excited about the opportunities to work collaboratively and learn from experienced professionals. This portfolio is my introduction to the industry, an open invitation to connect, collaborate, and explore possibilities together. <br><br>
            Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. If you're interested in discovering how an enthusiastic and determined entry-level developer can contribute to your projects, I'd love to hear from you. Let's embark on this journey together, where we can create and learn from the vast opportunities that software development offers. <br><br>
